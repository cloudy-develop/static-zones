# Static Zones
 
This repository is a FiveM resource that adds zones to the map when the server starts.

## Information
Static Zones is a really simple script that just adds zones to the map when the server loads.  Very similar to blips, but just zones. There are a few configuration settings that will make your in-game experience better.  After getting requests for this from my Random Zones script I felt I needed to just make a static zone script. Feel free to edit the script but do not re-upload it.
